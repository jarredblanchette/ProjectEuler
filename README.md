Project Euler is a set of puzzles, designed with the intention of teaching algorithm design and mathematical principles.

The puzzles are designed with a "One-Minute rule" in mind.  While many problems can be solved by a simple exhaustive search, an efficient solution will find the solution in under a minute on a modestly powered computer.

This repo contains my solutions to these puzzles.  

Tests are run with `pytest`, which can be run either in a specific problem directory, or in the problem directory itself to run all tests.
